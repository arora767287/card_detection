#NRIC Identification Card Reader Code

This project takes in an NRIC card, scans the input, and returns the information contained on the card about the person who it belongs to. The information returned includes the person's name, their date of birth, their nationality, their FIN Number, and their gender.

USAGE

To use this program, install the following libraries using the Python pip installation package:

cv2
numpy
imutils

The program landscape images of the NRIC card as input, so make sure the width of the input image is larger than its height. It also works best when the image
of the NRIC card is taken from a distance, and is centered in the frame of the picture (straightened).
